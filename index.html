					<h1 class="section-title">Welcome</h1>
					<p>On behalf of the Northwest Filipino American Student Alliance, FASA sa UW Bothell welcomes you to NWFASA Conference 2017! Our theme for the 22nd Annual NWFASA Conference is <strong>“Isang Bagsak: Moving Forward in Solidarity.“</strong></p>
					<p>“Isang Bagsak” is translated to “One Down” or “One Fall”, an action of a singular clap by a group of people that originated from the 1960’s by the Farm Workers Movement in California. Figuratively, it is a statement representing unity and empowerment.</p>
					<p>We are excited and humbled to be part of this experience with you. So whether you are a returning conference attendee or if this is your first time attending the NWFASA Conference, we welcome you!</p>
					<p class="sincerely">Sincerely,</p>
					<p class="signature">2017 NWFASA Conference Committee</p>

					<span class="pillar">Social</span>
					<div class="description">“Cross the Line” is a powerful, interactive, and effective activity that builds diversity awareness within a group. We are going to help identify the similarities and differences we have amongst each other. We want to acknowledge and address those differences, but also bring to the surface other differences that we may not have recognized. The goals of this activity include helping participants learn about themselves, providing them with opportunity to reflect upon their self- and cultural identity, allowing the community involved to appreciate its own diversity more and learning to treat each other like the diverse human beings we all are, instead of allowing ourselves to be divided by our diversity. We want to empower the group by breaking down stereotypes and assumptions, produced by our cultures and experiences, and make it easier to know one another as human beings.</div>

					<div class="description">Have you ever been “called out” by someone and you weren’t quite sure what to do? Or maybe you’ve called someone out and it wasn’t as effectively as you’d hoped it would be. There is a culture of calling people out on college campuses and social media, and it is often responded with defense and stubbornness. However, if we want to make effective social changes in our community we have to engage in conversations with the best intentions and most positive impacts. This workshop is an opportunity to talk about the intricacies of Call-Out Culture, how to respond when you’re being called out, and how to engage with others when you’re calling them out.</div>
